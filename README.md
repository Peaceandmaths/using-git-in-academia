A short introduction about git and its main features
- [About git](https://t4d-gmbh.github.io/working-with-git/git/about.html)
- [Basic elements](https://t4d-gmbh.github.io/working-with-git/git/basic_elements.html)
- ... _basically most of what is in `Git Workflow` in the working-with-git repo_
#### The basic workflow with git
#### Some useful commands
#### Collaboration with git
- Underlying principles
- The "feature branch" workflow
A simple collaboration approach suitable for most cases
#### Examples and learning by doing

### 3. Part: Continuous Integration and Delivery
_Also in [Git and its Remotes](https://github.com/t4d-gmbh/git-and-its-remotes) or separate repo?_

#### Why remotes offer automation
#### Basic structure of a workflow
_Covering both GitHub and GitLab is probably an overkill, maybe just focus on GitLab_
#### About runners
- how they can be set up
- a word about security
#### Automation for non-software developer
- build artifacts (like a .pdf from a .tex)
- continuously test your code 
- write documentations

#### Examples and learning by doing
Presenting the .tex paper example repo with pipeline to build .pdf and multiple
different branches (different formatting for journals).

_That would be the end of part 2_
